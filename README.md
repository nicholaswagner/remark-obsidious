# remark-rockcandy
A Remark.js plugin for transforming Obsidian-flavored Markdown ASTs into a structured format, making callouts, highlights, and embeds easier to process for static-site generators and markdown renderers.

# This is very proof of concept right now.  
It could be useful as a reference for someone writing custom obsidian transformers, but let me dogfood this beast for a bit before you try to use it in anything you care about.  I anticipate that I'll be making heavy changes over the next week or two.
